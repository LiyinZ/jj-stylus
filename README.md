# Lodepen - Quick little local front-end sandbox 

I'm not satisfied with the speed of [Codepen](http://codepen.io), so I've created this to serve as local Codepen.

### Advantages

* Sync across multiple browsers / machines instantly (thanks to [Browsersync](http://www.browsersync.io)) upon changes
* Automatically complies pre-processors like Jade and Stylus (currently)
* debug on Chrome dev tools without the extra wrapper from Codepen's site
* add jQuery, AngularJS with bower, just like quick add in Codepen's setting

### Install

Just clone or download zip for now ...

to start, run "npm install", "bower install", and then "gulp" for serving and watching
